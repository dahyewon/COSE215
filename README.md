[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) is a general-purpose programming language combining **object-oriented** and **functional** programming in one concise, high-level language. Scalaâ€™s **static types** help avoid bugs in complex applications, and its JVM and JavaScript runtimes let you build high-performance systems with easy access to huge ecosystems of libraries.

The interactive **build tool** [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) is built for Scala and Java projects.
